prompt1 = "==== Flash Flood Warning for Manteo, North Carolina ====
Take Immediate Action: The Wilmington National Weather Service Office has activated the 
Emergency Alert Systems. You are receiving this alert because your residential area and 
surroundings are in grave threat due to dangerous floodwaters.
This alert is in effect based on the latest weather forecast for Hurricane Florence 2018. 
Steady rainfall has already graced our region with 26 inches of precipitation since the 
hurricane's landfall. The situation is expected to exacerbate with an additional 3 to 6 
inches of rainfall imminent. The rainfall is occurring at approximately 1 to 2 inches per 
hour.
The time of this notice is 1:24 PM on Sunday, September 16th, 2018. The alert will expire 
at 9:30 PM tonight but stay vigilant for updates. 
Impacted Areas: The counties nearby Wilmington, North Carolina, and cities and landmarks 
within the flood threat zone. Manteo and surrounding areas are included in the impact 
list. 
Severe Flood Threatening Conditions: Under such heavy and sustained rain, expect flash 
floods to occur. Floodwaters are predicted to attain extreme heights. The overwhelmed and 
saturated ground accelerates the flooding as it cannot absorb the mass amounts of rain 
quickly. 
Immediate Actions to Take: Find higher ground immediately. Do NOT attempt to travel unless
escaping an area that’s under flooding. Avoid walking or driving through flood waters, 
remember, "Turn around, don’t drown!" Just 6 inches of moving water can knock down a 
person, and one foot of water can sweep a vehicle away.
Be Prepared: Keep alert for possible Flood Warnings and be prepared to evacuate if Flood 
Warnings are issued. Listen to local media or NOAA Weather Radio for updates.
Residents of affected areas, your safety is our top concern. Please adhere to these 
recommendations and stay safe."

prompt2 = "THIS IS AN EMERGENCY ALERT. The Wilmington National Weather Service office has activated 
the Emergency Alert Systems due to a dangerous flash flood warning. PLEASE TAKE IMMEDIATE 
ACTION.
As of 1:24 PM on Sunday, September 16th, 2018, Hurricane Florence has brought about up to 
26 inches of rain already, with another 3 to 6 inches anticipated. Rain is falling at a 
rate of 1 to 2 inches per hour.
Please be REVISED - this alert will EXPIRE at 9:30 PM on the same day.
Areas around Wilmington, including the town of Manteo in Dare County, Currituck, Hyde, 
Beaufort, Craven, and other nearby parts of eastern North Carolina, will be severely 
impacted by this storm. Landmarks such as the Cape Hatteras Seashore, Roanoke Island, Lake
Mattamuskeet, the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway as well as major highways and roads are 
included in this warning.
Flash floods are extremely dangerous - floodwaters could RISE TO DANGEROUS HEIGHTS very

heavy rainfall from Hurricane Florence is leading to this risk.

or waterways. Move to higher ground IMMEDIATELY. If you are at home, always STAY ON THE 
UPPER FLOORS. Make sure to turn off ELECTRICITY if water begins to enter your home. Keep a
BATTERY-OPERATED RADIO handy for updates.
STAY SAFE and make sure you are prepared with a THREE-DAY SUPPLY of food, water, and 
essential medication for each member of your household. Secure important documents in
