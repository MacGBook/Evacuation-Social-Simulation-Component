#Set the evacuation message to be used as a string:
evacuation_message = "Attention Residents of Manteo, North Carolina! This is an urgent FLASH FLOOD WARNING from the Wilmington, National Weather Service Office. Critical weather conditions from Hurricane Florence have activated Emergency Alert Systems. This message is of utmost importance and immediate action is required. As of 1 24 PM on Sunday, September 16th, 2018, torrential rain is creating life-threatening floodwaters in your vicinity. Up to 26 inches of rain have already soaked our region since Hurricane Florence made landfall, and the rain continues to fall at rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour. Another 3 to 6 inches of rain are anticipated to further exacerbate the serious flood conditions we are currently experiencing. This warning applies particularly to areas around Wilmington, North Carolina and surrounding counties. Be aware that other major cities and landmarks in close proximity will also be victim to these dangerous conditions. Flash flood conditions raise water levels rapidly - in this instance, due to the excessive rainfall. Early predictions show that the rising waterways may reach dangerous heights, pose life-threatning danger and cause transportation disruption. Here are the major actions you should take IMMEDIATELY: 1 DO NOT attempt to cross or drive through flooded roadways or paths. They are more dangerous than they appear. 2 Prepare for immediate evacuation if authorities indicate it is necessary or when water levels rise close to your area. 3 Gather essential items, important documents, medication, and emergency kits. 4 Inform family members, neighbors, and officials if you need assistance. This flash flood warning will remain in effect until 9 30 PM tonight. Note, conditions may change, stay ALERT for further updates and instructions from official channels. Remember, your safety is the priority. Act now!"
